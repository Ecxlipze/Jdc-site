                                    on its journey
                                    starting from a small camp established at a densely populated area of Aisha Manzil,
                                    Karachi. Initially, it catered the flood disaster victims and places, but later on,
                                    it worked hard to spread its branches and reach out to an effective infrastructure
                                    that deals with liberation and rescue management all across the province.
